abstract = {In order to automatically generate high-quality game levels, one needs to be able to automatically verify that the levels are playable. The simulation-based approach to playability testing uses an artificial agent to play through the level, but building such an agent is not always an easy task and such an agent is not always readily available. We discuss this prob-lem in the context of the physics-based puzzle game Cut the Rope, which features continuous time and state space, mak-ing several approaches such as exhaustive search and reactive agents inefficient. We show that a deliberative Prolog-based agent can be used to suggest all sensible moves at each state, which allows us to restrict the search space so that depth-first search for solutions become viable. This agent is successfully used to test playability in Ropossum, a level generator based on grammatical evolution. The method proposed in this paper is likely to be useful for a large variety of games with similar characteristics.},

The puzzles consist of unit square blocks on an integer lattice; all blocks are movable. The robot may move horizontally and vertically in order to reach a specified goal position. The puzzle variants differ in the number of blocks that the robot can push at once, ranging from at most one (Push-1) up to arbitrarily many (Push-*). Other variations were introduced to make puzzles more tractable, in which blocks must slide their maximal extent when pushed (PushPush), and in which the robot's path must not revisit itself (Push-X). We prove that all of these puzzles are NP-hard. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Hearn2005,
abstract = {We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be PSPACE-complete by a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic. Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the "Generalized Rush Hour Logic" developed by Flake and Baum [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 270(1-2) (2002) 895]. We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are PSPACE-hard. Our main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block puzzles are PSPACE-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes (1×2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush HourTM puzzles are PSPACE-complete [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 270(1-2) (2002) 895], of which we also give a simpler proof. We also greatly strengthen the conditions for the PSPACE-hardness of the Warehouseman's Problem [Int. J. Robot. Res. 3(4) (1984) 76], a classic motion-planning problem. Finally, we strengthen the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is PSPACE-complete [In: Proc. Internat. Conf. on Fun with Algorithms, Elba, Italy, June 1998, pp. 65-76.], by showing that it is PSPACE-complete even if no barriers are allowed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
