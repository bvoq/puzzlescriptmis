Intell. 3 (1991) 131â€“150]. The puzzles consist of unit square blocks on an integer lattice; all blocks are movable. The robot may move horizontally and vertically in order to reach a specified goal position. The puzzle variants differ in the number of blocks that the robot can push at once, ranging from at most one (Push-1) up to arbitrarily many (Push-âˆ—). Other variations were introduced to make puzzles more tractable, in which blocks must slide their maximal extent when pushed (PushPush), and in which the robot's path must not revisit itself (Push-X). We prove that all of these puzzles are NP-hard."

abstract = {The game of Sokoban is an interesting platform for algorithm research. It is hard for humans and computers alike. Even small levels can take a lot of computation for all known al-gorithms. In this paper we will describe how a search based Sokoban solver can be structured and which algorithms can be used to realize each critical part. We implement a variety of those, construct a number of different solvers and combine them into an algorithm portfolio. The solver we construct this way can outperform existing solvers when run in parallel, i.e. our solver with 16 processors outperforms the previous se-quential solvers.},

Our method generates puzzles through simulated game play, guaranteeing solvability in all generated puzzles. We perform a user study to infer features that are efficient to compute and are highly correlated with expected puzzle difficulty. We combine several of these features into a data-driven evaluation function for MCTS puzzle creation. The resulting algorithm is efficient and can be run in an anytime manner, capable of quickly generating a variety of challenging puzzles. We perform a second user study to validate the predictive capability of our approach, showing a high correlation between increasing puzzle scores and perceived difficulty.},

@article{Khalifa2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a general technique to generate and evaluate puzzle levels made by Puzzle Script. Puzzle Script is a videogame description language - created by Stephen Lavelle - for scripting puzzle games. We propose a system to help in generating levels for Puzzle Script without any restriction on the current game rules. Two different approaches are used with a trade off between speed (Constructive approach) and playability (Genetic approach). These two approaches use a level evaluator that calculates the scores of the generated levels based on their playability and challenge. The generated levels are assessed by human players statistically, and the results show that the con- structive approach is capable of generating playable levels up to 90{\%}, while genetic approach can reach up to 100{\%}. The results also show a high correlation between the system scores and the human scores.},

The authors also conclude that, at least until design conversations are better understood, we should concentrate less on pictures and more on words.

title = "Ropossum: An authoring tool for designing, optimizing and solving cut the Rope levels",
abstract = "We present a demonstration of Ropossum, an authoring tool for the generation and testing of levels of the physics-based game, Cut the Rope. Ropossum integrates many features: (1) automatic design of complete solvable content, (2) incorporation of designer's input through the creation of complete or partial designs, (3) automatic check for playability and (4) optimization of a given design based on playability. The system includes a physics engine to simulate the game and an evolutionary framework to evolve content as well as an AI reasoning agent to check for playability. The system is optimised to allow on-line feedback and realtime interaction.",

@article{Taylor2011,
abstract = {We describe an algorithm for the procedural generation of levels for the popular Japanese puzzle game Sokoban. The algorithm takes a few parameters and builds a random in-stance of the puzzle that is guaranteed to be solvable. Al-though our algorithm and its implementation runs in ex-ponential time, we present experimental evidence that it is sufficiently fast for offline use on a current generation PC when used to generate levels of size and complexity similar to those human-designed levels currently available online.},

abstract="We establish some general schemes relating the computational complexity of a video game to the presence of certain common elements or mechanics, such as destroyable paths, collecting items, doors activated by switches or pressure plates, etc.. Then we apply such ``metatheorems'' to several video games published between 1980 and 1998, including Pac-Man, Tron, Lode Runner, Boulder Dash, Deflektor, Mindbender, Pipe Mania, Skweek, Prince of Persia, Lemmings, Doom, Puzzle Bobble 3, and Starcraft. We obtain both new results, and improvements or alternative proofs of previously known results.",
